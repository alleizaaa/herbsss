<p><strong>Anti-Oxidant Protective Effects of Cassia Alata in Rats Exposed to Carbon Tetrachloride</strong>
A study done in Department of Biochemistry, University of Port Harcourt, investigated the protective activity of Cassia alata against carbon tetrachloride– induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Crude extracts of petals of the plant in 0.5% ethanol were administered by intubation for 14 days prior to injection of 0.5ml Kg-1 CCl4 into the rats. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, 18 hours after CCl4 administration, decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in rats treated with the extracts than in CCl4 – treated rats only. These findings suggest that Cassia alata may be protective against hepatotoxin-induced liver damage in rats.
</p>
<p><strong>Analgesic activity of Cassia alata leaf extract and kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside</strong>
The analgesic activity of an extract of the leaves of Cassia alata and kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside were studied after intraperitoneal injection in mice and rats using the tail clip, tail flick, tail immersion and acetic acidinduced writhing methods and the results compared with morphine. Maximum analgesic activity of the extract was apparent 120 min after injection. Fifty milligrams of kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside appeared equivalent to 100 mg of the extract.

<h2 style="fontsize: 100%"><strong>Science Research: Momordica charantia Health Benefits</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Antioxidant properties of Momordica Charantia (bitter gourd) seeds on Streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.</strong>
The aim of the present study is to investigate the antioxidant activities of the aqueous extract of seeds of Momordica charantia in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Oral administration of seed extracts at a concentration of 150 mg/kg b.w for 30 days showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose, hepatic and renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and hydroperoxides. The treatment also resulted in a significant increase in reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats. The results clearly suggest that seeds of Momordica charantia treated group may effectively normalize the impaired antioxidant status in streptozotocin induced-diabetes than the glibenclamide treated groups. The extract exerted rapid protective effects against lipid peroxidation by scavenging of free radicals there by reducing the risk of diabetic complications.

</p>
<p><strong>Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) extract inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by modulating cell cycle regulatory genes and promotes apoptosis.</strong>
In this study, we have used human breast cancer cells, and primary human mammary epithelial cells as an in vitro model to assess the efficacy of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) extract as an anticancer agent. The bitter melon (Momordica charantia) extract treatment of breast cancer cells resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death. Subsequent studies showed that bitter melon extract treatment of breast cancer cells inhibited survivin and claspin expression. Further studies revealed that bitter melon extract treatment enhanced p53, p21, and pChk1/2 and inhibited cyclin B1 and cyclin D1 expression, suggesting an additional mechanism involving cell cycle regulation. Together, these results show that bitter melon extract modulates signal transduction pathways for inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and can be used as a dietary supplement for prevention of breast cancer.

<h4 style="fontsize: 100%"><strong>Bawang (Allium sativum L.) Herbal Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Bawang or garlic, is a specie in the onion family Alliaceae. Bawang is a close relative of onion (sibuyas), the shallot, the leek and the chive. Bawang has been used throughout recorded history for both culinary and medicinal purposes.
Bawang is a low herb, growing to up to 2 feet high. Bawang is widely popular for its bulbs. Bawang bulbs are broadly ovoid, 2 to 4 cm in diameter, consisting of several cloves. Bawang leaves are linear and flat. Umbels are globose, many flowered. Sepas are oblong, greenish white, slightly tinged with purple.
Bawang has a characteristic pungent, spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking. Bawang cloves are used as seed, for consumption (raw or cooked), and for medicinal purposes. The leaves, stems (scape) and flowers (bulbils) on the head (spathe) are also edible and most often consumed while immature and still tender.</p>
<p>Potential of garlic (Allium sativum) in lowering high blood pressure:
Garlic supplements have shown promise in the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension, lowering blood pressure (BP) by about 10 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic, similar to standard BP medication.  Hypertension could be alleviated with supplementation of organosulfur compounds derived from garlic 
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
<li>Bawang - Antiinfectious: Antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic. Bawang juice is applied to the afflicted area. Scientifically ajoene 0.4% cream when applied topically, has been found 70% effective in certain dermatologic fungal infections. A 0.6% gel was effective in tinea corporis and tinea cruris.n</li>
<li>Bawang - Hypertension: Bawang when eaten or chewed raw. Studies suggest ingestion of Bawang has beneficial antihypertensive effect but blood-lowering effects probably not dramatic. Other studies show a vascular benefit through improvement of aortic elasticity and possible slowing of the rate of atherosclerosis progression</li>
<li>Bawang - Hyperlipidemia: Bawang eaten or chewed raw is found to lower blood cholesterol. Though still controversial, but probably has beneficial effect on serum cholesterol and LDL levels. Some studies have shown a 4% to 12% lowering of total cholesterol. Bawang seems to have no effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL).</li>
<li>Bawang - Anti-cancer: Bawang is studied to have possible anticarcinogenic properties, specifically for colon, stomach and prostate cancers. In stomach cancers, probably through its inhibitory effect on H. pylori. In epidemiologic studies on stomach and colorectal cancer prevention, the garlic use was 3.5 grams to 30 grams of fresh or cooked garlic per week.</li>
<li>Colds, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, asthma and bronchitis; Nasal congestion steam inhalation of chopped Bawang and a teaspoon of vinegar in boiling water.</li>

<p>A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology April 2001, found the temporary infertility effect of yerba buena leaf extract In male albino mice, the petroleum ether extract of the leaves of Mentha arvensis L., at the doses 10 and 20 mg/mouse per day for 20, 40 and 60 days, when administered orally, showed a dose and duration dependent reduction in the number of offspring of the treated male mated with normal females. The results suggest that the petroleum ether extract of the leaves of Mentha arvensis possess reversible antifertility property without adverse toxicity in male mice. 
A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology Feb. 2005, has reported that the essential oils and ethanolic extracts from the leaves and/or roots of 35 medicinal plants commonly used in Brazil were screened for anti-Candida albicans activity.. Essential oils from 13 plants showed anti-Candida activity, including Aloysia triphylla, Anthemis nobilis,Cymbopogon martini, Cymbopogon winterianus, Cyperus articulatus, Cyperus rotundus,Lippia alba, Mentha arvensis, Mikania glomerata, Mentha piperita, Mentha sp., Stachys byzantina, and Solidago chilensis.. Chemical analyses showed the presence of compounds with known antimicrobial activity, including 1,8-cineole, geranial, germacrene-d, limonene, linalool, and menthol.
Enhancement of the antibiotic activity against a multiresistant Escherichia coli by Mentha arvensis L. and chlorpromazine.
A study published in the journal of Chemotheraphy 2008, reported the testing of the antibiotic resistance-modifying activity of Mentha arvensis. It concluded and suggested that extracts from Mentha arvensis (yerba buena) could be used as a source of plant-derived natural products with resistance-modifying activity, such as in the case of gentamicin, constituting a new weapon against bacterial resistance to antibiotics, as with chlorpromazine.
Antioxidant, antimicrobial, cytotoxic and analgesic activities of ethanolic extract of Mentha arvensis L
In a study published in , it reported that the extract showed free radical scavenging activity in the DPPH assay (IC50∼41 μg/mL) compared to the standard antioxidant ascorbic acid (IC50∼19 μg/mL). The extract also produced prominent antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella boydii, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus aureuscompared to standard drug kanamycin at the dose of 30 μg/disc.. In analgesic test, the extract demonstrated statistically significant analgesic effect in acetic acid induced writhing in white albino mice at both dose levels. These results suggest that the ethanolic extract of Mentha arvensis L. has potential antioxidant, antibacterial, cytotoxic and analgesic activities that support the ethnopharmacological uses of this plant.
Ameliorative role of Mentha arvensis against the Aluminum induced Oxidative Stress in Albino mice
